    <h3>Decription</h3>

    <p>This recipe yields a crust that is soft and doughy
    on the inside and slightly crusty on the outside. 
    Cover it with your favorite sauce and topping to 
    make a delicious pizza.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li>2&frac12; teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
      <li>&frac12; teaspoon brown sugar</li>
      <li>1&frac12; cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>3&frac13; cups all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast and brown sugar 
          in the water, and let sit for 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Stir the salt and oil into the yeast solution. 
          Mix in 2 &frac12; cups of the flour.</li>
      <li>Turn dough out onto a clean, well floured surface, and knead 
          in more flour until the dough is no longer sticky. Place the dough 
          into a well oiled bowl, and cover with a cloth. Let the dough rise 
          until double; this should take about 1 hour. Punch down the dough, and 
          form a tight ball. Allow the dough to relax for a minute before 
          rolling out. Use for your favorite pizza recipe.</li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). If you are baking the dough
          on a pizza stone, you may place your toppings on the dough, and bake immediately.
          If you are baking your pizza in a pan, lightly oil the pan, and let the dough 
          rise for 15 or 20 minutes before topping and baking it.</li>
      <li>Bake pizza in preheated oven, until the cheese and crust are golden brown, 
          about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
